# Changelog

Every working session on this project appends an entry here. Format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); the project is pre-release, so
entries are grouped by date and phase rather than by version.

An entry records **what changed and why** — decisions, reversals and incidents included,
not just additions. A change that reversed an earlier decision says so. See `CLAUDE.md`
for the convention.

## 2026-08-25 — Phase 0: Foundation

First working session. Project went from specification-only to a running Windows app.

### Added — tooling and version control

- **Version control.** Repository initialised, first commit, and pushed to the private
  GitHub repo `vnikie1/MailBox`. `.gitattributes` normalises line endings to LF so working
  on Windows does not rewrite every file on checkout.
- **`CHANGELOG.md` and `CLAUDE.md`.** `CLAUDE.md` loads into context at the start of every
  session, and instructs that this changelog is updated in the same session as the work,
  unprompted, with incidents mandatory. That file is the enforcement mechanism.

### Changed — product name

- **Product renamed from the placeholder `Halyard` to `MailBox`** across `package.json`,
  `Cargo.toml` (crate `mailbox`, lib `mailbox_lib`), `tauri.conf.json`, the window title,
  the log filter env var (`HALYARD_LOG` → `MAILBOX_LOG`) and the CI artifact name.

  The bundle identifier stays `com.uniki.mailclient`. It was deliberately decoupled from
  the display name when the placeholder was chosen, precisely so a rename would cost
  nothing: Tauri derives the `%LOCALAPPDATA%` data directory from the identifier, so no
  mail store moves and no update channel breaks. Verified green after the rename —
  13 vitest, 6 playwright, 4 cargo tests, clippy clean, `mailbox.exe` builds.

### Added

- **Toolchain** (installed on the dev machine, not in the repo): Node 24.19.0 / npm 11.17.0,
  Rust 1.98.0 `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`, Visual Studio Build Tools 2022 17.14.39 with MSVC
  14.44.35207 and Windows SDK 10.0.26100. WebView2 151 was already present.
- **Scaffold**: Tauri 2.11 + React 19 + TypeScript 5.7 + Vite 6, laid out per
  `docs/03-architecture.md` §9.
- **Three-tier design tokens** — `src/styles/tokens/{primitive,semantic,component}.css`
  plus `global.css`. Colour, space, radius, motion and the full type scale from
  `docs/02-design-system.md` §2–§4.
- **Rust core**:
  - `platform/backdrop.rs` — DWM system backdrop, immersive dark mode, rounded corners.
  - `platform/appearance.rs` — theme, OS accent and the transparency setting via WinRT
    `UISettings`, with change events debounced and marshalled to the main thread.
  - `ipc/window.rs` — the `appearance_get` command.
  - `src-tauri/capabilities/default.json` — a deliberately granular permission set.
- **UI**: `Titlebar`, `ShellDiagnostics` (live host/theme/accent/backdrop/DPI readout),
  a Zustand appearance store and `useAppearanceSync`.
- **Tooling**: ESLint 9 flat config with type-aware rules, Prettier, Stylelint, Vitest,
  Playwright, and a three-job GitHub Actions workflow (frontend / Rust core / installer).
- **Stylelint rule enforcing standing rule 1** — a hex colour, `rgb()` literal, `px`
  length, duration or raw easing curve inside any `*.module.css` fails the build.
- **App icon** and `tools/make-icon.cjs`, a dependency-free PNG generator.
- **`docs/PHASE-0-VERIFICATION.md`** — what is verified, what is not, and every deviation
  from the specs with its reasoning.

### Changed

- **Backdrop is Mica Alt, not Acrylic** (`PROMPT.md` step 3 and `docs/03` §8 say Acrylic).
  Acrylic blurs whatever is behind the window; Mica samples the wallpaper and desaturates
  when inactive, which is the macOS sidebar behaviour `docs/01` §3 describes. Verified
  working in the running app.
- **`--accent-hover` is derived** via `color-mix` from `--accent` instead of the fixed
  `#0A6FD8` / `#3D9BFF` in `docs/02` §3. The accent follows the Windows OS accent, so a
  fixed hover hex is wrong the moment it is not blue. The ratios reproduce the doc's values
  to within ~1/255.
- **`--accent-fg` is chosen at runtime** from the accent's luminance rather than always
  white. White on a yellow OS accent is ~1.6:1.
- **Type scale expressed as offsets from `--font-size-base`**, resolving a conflict in
  `docs/02` §1 vs §7: density must swap only `component.css`, but density changes the base
  size and the scale sat outside all three tiers. At the default 13px base the doc's table
  is reproduced exactly.
- **Drag region uses `data-tauri-drag-region`**, not `-webkit-app-region: drag` as in
  `docs/02` §6.1. The CSS property is a Chromium app-shell feature WebView2 does not honour.
- **Window is decorated (`decorations: true`)** — reverses the custom-titlebar approach
  built earlier the same session. See _Removed_ and the note below.

### Removed

- **The custom caption buttons and their entire Win32 hit-testing layer**:
  `platform/titlebar.rs`, `CaptionButtons.tsx`, the `set_caption_button_rects` command, the
  caption hover/press event channel, the `--caption-*` / `--font-caption-glyph` /
  `--win-close-*` tokens, and the window minimise/maximise/close capabilities.

  _Why:_ Snap Layouts requires `WM_NCHITTEST` to answer `HTMAXBUTTON`, and an undecorated
  Tauri window never receives that message for client-area points — `TAURI_DRAG_RESIZE_BORDERS`,
  `WRY_WEBVIEW` and the `Chrome_*` windows all span the full client rect, and the `Chrome_*`
  ones belong to the WebView2 process so they cannot be subclassed. Instrumentation was
  unambiguous: 27 hit tests for the resize borders, zero for anything inside the client
  area. Letting Windows own the caption strip makes Snap Layouts, hover, press, `Alt`+`Space`
  and screen-reader support native and unable to regress.

  _Cost:_ a ~32px system caption above the 52px toolbar — 84px of chrome against macOS
  Mail's unified 52px. The largest visual deviation in the project so far. Mica shows
  through both, so they read as one band. Revisit the toolbar height in Phase 2.

- **The `Acrylic` backdrop variant**, unused until Phase 1 has menus and popovers to put it
  on (standing rule 18).

### Fixed

- `tauri.conf.json`: NSIS `installMode` `perUser` → `currentUser` (invalid value).
- `windows` crate 0.61 import paths: `BOOL` is in `windows::core`, `ScreenToClient` in
  `Win32::Graphics::Gdi`; added the `Win32_Graphics_Gdi` feature.
- `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` violations in `vite.config.ts` and `playwright.config.ts`.
- Clippy: an unnecessary pointer cast in `hwnd_of`.
- ESLint/Stylelint config errors — backslash escaping in the Stylelint regexes, and
  type-aware rules being applied to plain-JS config files.
- **Missing `src-tauri/capabilities/default.json`.** In Tauri v2 a webview gets no core
  permissions without one, so `listen()`, `isMaximized()` and `startDragging()` were all
  being denied silently.

### Incidents

- **Prettier reformatted the specification documents.** `prettier --write .` ran before
  `.prettierignore` was scoped and reflowed `docs/*.md`, `README.md` and `PROMPT.md` —
  markdown tables realigned, `*emphasis*` → `_emphasis_`, CSS inside code fences reformatted.
  Content intact; formatting is not as authored, and there was no commit to restore from.
  `.prettierignore` now excludes `docs/`, `README.md` and `PROMPT.md` permanently.
- **Smart App Control blocked the Rust build.** `cargo build` failed with
  `os error 4551 — An Application Control policy has blocked this file` on several crates'
  build scripts (CodeIntegrity event 3077). Resolved without disabling Smart App Control:
  the build completes with `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` outside `C:\Users\<user>\Documents`, and
  previously-blocked binaries later ran untouched, so the blocks appear time- and
  load-sensitive rather than a fixed rule. See `docs/PHASE-0-VERIFICATION.md` §3.

### Notes

- Twenty conflicts and gaps were found across `docs/01`–`docs/06` — broken cross-references,
  a 13px/13.5px font-size disagreement, FTS5 `content=''` vs external-content, row-height
  arithmetic that does not close against the line-height, a missing `gm_msgid` column, and
  keyset pagination that only supports date sort. Recorded in the session review; the
  load-bearing ones are reflected in `docs/PHASE-0-VERIFICATION.md` §4.
- `assets/reference/` is still empty. It blocks the Phase 2 exit gate, not this one, and
  filling it needs half an hour on a Mac running Sequoia.
